                    <h3>Self Protection Guidelines</h3>
                    <p>Civil Protection, in collaboration with the National Meteorological Institute, is responsible for informing the public, through the media, of those weather events that can lead to hazardous situations.
                    <p>In these situations, it is very important to pay attention to the official information broadcast on radio stations and in other media, and follow the instructions given.
                    <p>In the event of possible emergencies caused by heavy rains, a series of preliminary measures should be adopted to help prevent or at least mitigate their impact.
                    <p>Among the measures to be adopted in your house, it is advisable to keep in mind, especially if you live in areas with flood risk, these precautions:
                    <ul>
                    <li>&nbsp;- Remove any objects that could be washed away from the exterior of the house.
                    <li>&nbsp;- Check, from time to time, the state of the roof, the building's down spouts and the nearby drains.
                    <li>&nbsp;- Place important documents and, especially, hazardous products, in those parts of the house where the risk of their deteriorating due to moisture or their spilling is reduced.
                    <li>&nbsp;- Do not park vehicles or camp in dry riverbeds or on river banks, to avoid being surprised by a sudden rise in water level or a torrent.
                    </ul>
                    <p><p><strong>SELF-PROTECTION MEASURES TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF EMERGENCY DUE TO HEAVY RAINS</strong>

                    <li>&nbsp;- In the event of emergency situations due to heavy rains, it is very important to:
                    <li>&nbsp;- Stay constantly informed, through the radio and other media, of weather forecasts and the state of the situation.
                    <li>&nbsp;- Should your house be flooded, it is essential to leave basements and ground floors as soon as possible and disconnect the electrical power, preferably using torches for lighting.
                    <li>&nbsp;- If you must travel, try to stay on major roads and highways.
                    <li>&nbsp;- If you are in the countryside, stay away from rivers, streams and low-lying areas of slopes and hills, avoiding, in turn, crossing flooded fords.

                    </ul>
